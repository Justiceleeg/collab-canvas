## PR #22: Basic AI Chat Panel ü§ñ (Minimal)

**Priority:** HIGH (Foundation)  
**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours  
**Status:** PLANNED

**Goal:** Get a working AI chat panel that can have conversations about the canvas (queries only, no commands yet).

### Tasks:

#### 1. Install dependencies
- Files: `package.json`
- Run: `pnpm add ai @ai-sdk/react @ai-sdk/openai zod`
- Note: Updated packages per [Vercel AI SDK docs](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/getting-started/nextjs-app-router)

#### 2. Setup environment
- Files: `.env.local`
- Add `OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here`
- Document in README (don't commit actual key)

#### 3. Create basic AI types
- Files: `types/ai.types.ts`
- Define `AIMessage` type (id, role, content, timestamp)
- Keep it simple for now - just chat messages

#### 4. Create basic API route
- Files: `app/api/ai/chat/route.ts`
- Use Vercel AI SDK pattern from docs
- Import: `openai` from `@ai-sdk/openai`
- Import: `streamText, convertToModelMessages` from `ai`
- Simple system prompt: "You are a helpful assistant for a collaborative canvas app"
- Accept messages, stream response
- No command execution yet - just conversational

#### 5. Update UI store for AI panel
- Files: `store/uiStore.ts`
- Add `aiPanel: { isOpen: boolean, messages: AIMessage[] }`
- Add `toggleAIPanel()`, `setAIPanelOpen()`
- Add `addAIMessage()`, `clearAIMessages()`
- Mutual exclusion with properties panel

#### 6. Create minimal AI panel component
- Files: `components/Canvas/AIPanel.tsx`
- Use `useChat` hook from `@ai-sdk/react`
- Fixed right side panel (copy properties panel structure)
- Collapsible, defaults to closed
- Message list with auto-scroll
- Simple input field (Enter to send, Shift+Enter for newline)
- Display messages with role (User/AI)
- "Thinking..." during loading state
- Match existing panel styling

#### 7. Add keyboard shortcut
- Files: `hooks/useKeyboardShortcuts.ts`
- Cmd/Ctrl+K toggles AI panel
- Prevent default browser behavior

#### 8. Integrate into Canvas
- Files: `components/Canvas/Canvas.tsx`
- Render `AIPanel` component
- Position next to properties toggle button

### Deliverable:

- ‚úÖ AI chat panel visible and toggleable with Cmd/Ctrl+K
- ‚úÖ Can have conversations with AI about canvas
- ‚úÖ "Thinking..." animation during AI responses
- ‚úÖ Session-based history (clears on reload)
- ‚úÖ Mutually exclusive with properties panel
- ‚úÖ Clean UI matching existing panels

### Test Queries:
- "Hello, what can you help me with?"
- "What shapes can I create on this canvas?"
- "How do I select multiple shapes?"

## PR #23: AI Command Execution üéØ

**Priority:** HIGH (Core functionality)  
**Estimated Time:** 3-4 hours  
**Status:** PLANNED

**Goal:** Add ability for AI to execute simple commands (creation and manipulation).

### Tasks:

#### 1. Update AI types
- Files: `types/ai.types.ts`
- Add command types: `CreateShapeCommand`, `MoveShapeCommand`, `ResizeShapeCommand`, `RotateShapeCommand`
- Add `AICommandResult` type

#### 2. Create color parser utility
- Files: `utils/colors.ts` (new)
- `parseColor(colorName: string): string` - Convert color names to hex
- Support common colors: red, blue, green, yellow, orange, purple, pink, black, white, gray
- Support variations: "dark blue", "light red", etc.
- Return hex if already in hex format
- Test: `parseColor("red") => "#FF0000"`, `parseColor("#FF0000") => "#FF0000"`

#### 3. Create shape finder utilities
- Files: `utils/shapeQuery.ts` (new)
- `findShapesByColor(objects, color)` - Find shapes matching color (accepts hex or name)
- `findShapesByType(objects, type)` - Find all shapes of specific type
- `findSelectedShapes(objects, selectedIds)` - Get currently selected shapes
- `findBestMatch(objects, criteria)` - Find shape matching description (type + color)
- Test: Can find shapes by color, type, and combination of criteria

#### 4. Create AI agent service
- Files: `services/aiAgent.service.ts`
- `analyzeCanvas(objects)` - Returns canvas summary (shape count, types, positions)
- `executeCommand(command, commandService)` - Parses and executes commands
- Integration with `CanvasCommandService`
- Uses color parser and shape finder utilities
- Support 6 command types:
  - **Creation (3)**: Create rectangle/circle/text
  - **Manipulation (3)**: Move/resize/rotate shape

#### 5. Update API route with tools
- Files: `app/api/ai/chat/route.ts`
- Add canvas context to system prompt
- Define tools using Vercel AI SDK `tool()` function:
  - `createShape` - Create new shape
  - `moveShape` - Move existing shape
  - `resizeShape` - Resize shape
  - `rotateShape` - Rotate shape
- Include canvas state in each request
- Return tool results to UI

#### 6. Update AI panel for commands
- Files: `components/Canvas/AIPanel.tsx`
- Handle tool invocations in message display
- Show command execution status
- Display success/error feedback

#### 7. Pass canvas context to panel
- Files: `components/Canvas/Canvas.tsx`
- Pass `objects`, `commands`, `lockManager`, `user` to AIPanel
- Allow panel to execute commands

### Deliverable:

- ‚úÖ AI can create shapes: "Create a red circle"
- ‚úÖ AI can manipulate shapes: "Move the selected shape to x:500 y:300"
- ‚úÖ AI can resize: "Make it 200x200"
- ‚úÖ AI can rotate: "Rotate 45 degrees"
- ‚úÖ Commands execute and show in chat
- ‚úÖ Toast notifications on success/failure
- ‚úÖ Integrates with undo/redo

### Test Commands:
- "Create a blue rectangle"
- "Make a red circle at position 200, 300"
- "Move the selected shape to x:500 y:400"
- "Resize it to 150x150"
- "Rotate the shape 90 degrees"

  - 3 creation commands (rectangle, circle, text)
  - 3 manipulation commands (move, resize, rotate)
  - 3 layout commands (grid, distribute, align)
  - 3+ query commands (count, find, analyze)
  - 2+ complex commands (forms, navbars)
- ‚úÖ Covers all categories: creation, manipulation, layout, complex, query
- ‚úÖ Commands are diverse and meaningful

### Complex Command Execution (7-8 points)

- ‚úÖ "Create login form" produces 3+ properly arranged elements
- ‚úÖ Complex layouts execute multi-step plans correctly
- ‚úÖ Smart positioning (no overlap)
- ‚úÖ Handles ambiguity well

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Early validation** - See chat working in 2-3 hours
2. **Incremental testing** - Test each layer before adding complexity
3. **Risk reduction** - If time runs short, PR #22 + #23 cover core requirements
4. **Easier debugging** - Isolate issues by PR
5. **Better git history** - Clear progression of features

---

## Architecture Integration

The AI agent follows the existing 4-tier architecture:

- **Layer 1 (UI)**: `AIPanel.tsx` component + `uiStore.ts` state
- **Layer 2 (Interactions)**: Keyboard shortcuts (Cmd/Ctrl+K)
- **Layer 3 (Commands)**: `aiAgent.service.ts` + integration with existing `CanvasCommandService`
- **Layer 4 (Domain)**: Uses existing canvas store via command service

### Why This Works Well:

- ‚úÖ **Multi-user safe**: AI uses `CanvasCommandService`, which handles locking
- ‚úÖ **Undo/Redo**: Commands integrate with history system automatically
- ‚úÖ **Consistent UX**: AI executes same commands as keyboard/menu actions
- ‚úÖ **Testable**: Command logic separated from AI parsing
